# PayToPlay

This is the client app we built for our "Best In Show" entry to Over The Air's hack competition.

Originally we had this as a standalone project, but due to difficulties integrating Parrot's static library we added our code into their "FreeFlight" project. It works, and in the spirit of the event it's a total hack!
